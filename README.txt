# Evolution

Evolution is a mod for Minecraft that makes the game more realistic in many ways. Most features of the game have been completely remade from the ground up. As this mod is completely game changer, it is not recommended to be used with other mods. The mod is very early in its development and still is a Work in Progress. Expect bugs and unfinished features.
